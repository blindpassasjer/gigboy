# Changelog

All notable changes to Gigboy are documented here. The version shown in the
footer comes from `package.json`, injected at build time.

This project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) loosely while
pre-1.0: minor bumps for features, patch bumps for fixes.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Songs can have a duration (`3:45`); a setlist's header and its print sheet now show
  the total duration as the sum of its songs' lengths.
- A song's Settings panel has a toggle to show chords as letter names (C D E) or
  solfège (Do Re Mi); the chord diagram popup respects it too, and the choice is
  remembered per song.

### Fixed
- The sort dropdown on the song list no longer overlaps its own text in Safari.
- The transpose control no longer shows a redundant "(saved)" tag, and its reset
  button now only appears when the song is actually transposed away from its
  original key.
- The tab player now produces sound in production: the Content Security Policy had no
  `worker-src`, so it fell back to `script-src` (no `blob:`), and browsers were silently
  blocking the Worker Tone.js uses to schedule audio. Also stopped building the Web Audio
  sampler outside the Play button's click gesture, which Safari/iOS leave permanently
  suspended.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-09-09

Tooling only. No changes to features or data.

### Internal
- `npm run dev:demo` now binds Vite's port with `strictPort` when a
  `VITE_DEV_ORIGIN` is set, so it always lands on the port a reverse proxy
  forwards to and a second project's `dev:demo` fails loudly instead of
  drifting to a free port. Plain `npm run dev` is unaffected; override with
  `PORT` / `VITE_DEV_ORIGIN`.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-09-08

More design-system work. No changes to features or data.

### Changed
- Text sizes, spacing (gaps, padding, margins), and font weights now run
  through consistent scales instead of ~45 ad-hoc font sizes and ~35
  spacing values. Most elements shift by a pixel or two; the smallest
  labels come up to a 12px floor.
- Small field/section labels are lighter (medium weight) so they read as
  captions rather than competing with their content.
- Destructive actions (delete, remove) now use one consistent red across
  the app.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-08

Design system and cleanup pass. No changes to features or data.

### Changed
- Moved the version number under the footer tagline.
- Login page: dropped the animated backdrop decoration (glows, rings,
  sparks, grid); the drifting music notes remain, calmer, and now respect
  `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Page-header borders unified — list/setlist headers now match the plain
  border used elsewhere instead of an accent-tinted one.
- Small UI labels are no longer set in all caps.
- Buttons are consolidated onto one style vocabulary; non-primary buttons
  no longer carry a faint accent drop-shadow.

### Fixed
- Pill-shaped controls rendered with square corners after a token change
  collided with a Radix Themes variable.

### Internal
- Removed ~1,700 lines of dead CSS and two unused self-hosted webfonts.
- `border-radius` and elevation now run through a small token scale.
- Added a shared `Button` component and folded the ad-hoc button classes
  into it.
- `npm run dev:demo` runs the app against the in-browser demo backend with
  a login screen — no database needed for local UI work.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-07

- First tracked version. Introduces a visible version number (footer) and
  this changelog. No functional change to existing features.
